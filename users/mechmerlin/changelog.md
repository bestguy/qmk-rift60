# Changelog
All notable changes to my userspace will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.1] - 2018-10-26
### Added
- Added a changelog, aka THIS VERY FILE! 
- Added `config.h` to userspace for `RGBLIGHT_SLEEP` feature. 

### Changed
- Spruced up the readme file to better explain the things I use in my keymap for would be keymap snoopers. Also useful as an example when people ask. 
- Use `CTL_T` instead of `MT` for my custom `KC_CTCP` keycode as it was causing issues on some boards. 

## [0.1.0] - 2018-08-31
Initial usage of userspaces!
